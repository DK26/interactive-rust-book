# Setting

In the following chapter, I'll introduce a draft of the story narrative I've been working on for the book. This narrative combines an engaging plot with Rust learning topics. Developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, this draft is very much a work in progress and not set in stone. This means both that I might revise it and that community input is highly encouraged as the book evolves.

My current approach involves creating an interactive experience, similar to choose-your-own-adventure books. Given that there are already many traditional reference books on Rust, the aim here is to experiment with new, engaging ways to teach the languageâ€”or potentially any other topic. The plot, inspired by Cyberpunk themes and developed in collaboration with ChatGPT, incorporates elements from various movies and video games.

ChatGPT has contributed some ingenious ideas, such as drawing analogies between story entities and Rust components. Additionally, the platform has helped organize Rust topics in a manner that reinforces previously learned knowledge while progressively diving deeper into each subject. This method aligns with what I call the "Onion Model." In this model, learning about a topic is similar to peeling an onion: you start at the outer layer and progressively work your way toward the core. For instance, after initially learning about Rust traits, you'll eventually circle back to explore them in greater depth, focusing on advanced concepts like trait bounds and the difference between dynamic and static dispatch.

A dependency map will also be included to guide readers on which topics to master before advancing to more complex levels or certifications. For example, it will outline what you need to know to earn an entry-level Rust badge or achieve intermediate or advanced Rust proficiency.

## Current Story Structure

The narrative unfolds through the eyes of Alex, a character with a unisex name. You find yourself waking up in a basement, where an unexpected guest introduces you to a resistance movement fighting against a computer system that controls every aspect of human life. As Alex embarks on an adventure, you'll encounter a variety of characters and face difficult decisions. At times, wrong choices may lead to unpleasant consequences. Throughout the storyline, Rust-related puzzles are woven in, complete with brief tutorials that introduce new concepts. Side quests and bonus missions offer additional challenges, deepening your understanding of the material. The story's moral may come as a surprise.

I'm eager to continue working on this innovative project and welcome your participation in its development!
